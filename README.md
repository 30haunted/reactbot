# Discord ReactBot SelfBot ü§ñüí¨

A very simple SelfBot that allows auto reactions and has the ability to mass react with multiple emojis

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware that you can get rate limited if you like reactbot multiple members, I added a delay for multi-reactions so that you don't get rate limited
